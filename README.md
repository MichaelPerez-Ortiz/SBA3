Planetary Invasion_

By: Michael Perez-Ortiz 

 

Game Summary:	 

You are a member of the Jupiter Military Science Division. It has recently been discovered that your planet is reaching the end of its life. The only way to prevent this is to scour the galaxy in search of new technologies to keep your planet alive. You have been tasked with doing so, do you accept?	 

Game Outline: 

Players are tasked with searching the galaxy for the technology to save their planet Jupiter. The game splits into two seperate routes. One in which you accept have to decide the order in which you navigate the available planets while keeping in mind the time limit. Don't lose track of time you might not like the outcome. The other route yourun and have to deal with the consequences.

Try out all the different combinations of choices to find the ending you like best.

I could not get this to display the message I wanted. 

window.onbeforeunload = function(alert) {
    return "The game will reset. Continue?";
};



I looked on w3schools, stackoverflow, developer mozzilla and some youtube videos which all said to do whats below and that did notwork either.

// window.addEventListener("onbeforeunload" , function(alert) {
//     alert.preventDefault();
//     alert.returnValue = "";
//     return "The game will reset. Continue?";
// });


Also I might have commited a few things multiple times trying to figure out how to get back a commit I accidentally deleted when trying to edit it. Trying to fix this almost resulted in me losing a ton of progress. It also lead to me accidentally merging something. git is dangerous. I have learned to just leave typos alone. If you are reading this, heed my warning.
